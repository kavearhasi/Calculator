A straightforward and efficient Android application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—with a clean, user-friendly interface. Built using Kotlin and the Android SDK, this app prioritizes simplicity and functionality, allowing users to input numbers and operators seamlessly via an intuitive layout. A standout feature is the integrated calculation history, which securely saves previous computations, enabling users to revisit or reuse past results effortlessly. With responsive design principles and smooth performance, this project showcases my ability to create practical, user-focused mobile solutions that enhance everyday productivity.
